Book:
2.7 Performance  - timming breakdowm - how much time each iteration as function of data points

Zero order verification:
3.1 blcok diagram of top_tb
3.2 Test description
3.3 Test results
3.3.1 Zoom out - import signals: apb,go,
3.3.2 - Zooms in : inderect access, point classification,new centroids, interrupt

4 - Synthesis results
4.1 Technology - synthesis parameters,synthesis tool, clk freq, rams
4.2 Synthesis results - find worst path, see the slack and sicussion about slack(make screenshot) + power+ area
4.3 Floorplan - explain floorplain

5. Summary 
What we learned, ideas for future improvment, reset for next run issue,dividor issues, 


Final ppt:

Same design as midle ppt, same strcuture as project.
